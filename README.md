# Belly Button Biodiversity
In this project,I analyzed data of many different subjects and gathered data to create an inforgraphic dashboard based on belly button washing frequencies, as well as bacterial growth that was most common among subjects.

Based on where you hover, more information is given based on what dot, or bar graph you are hovering over. Some data was incomplete and only showed "bacteria" as a result, but many different results still appear among the data, as shown below:

As you scroll through the user data, you can see the graphs all change based on the certain subject you are clicking one, as you can see by subject ID 1536's frequency going up and the graph showing an increased amount of Staphylococcaceae being shown in the bar and bubble graphs, respectively.
